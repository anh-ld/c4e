1. Why should we use functions at all? 
   Because of its reusability. Once the function is defined, it can be used over and over again without rewriting the code.

2. How to define/declare a function? 
   Follow this syntax:
	def NAME( PARAMETERS ):
		STATEMENTS

3. How to call/use a function? 
   Call the function’s name with its parameters (if necessary) like this:
	NAME( PARAMETERS )

4. What is return, why and how do we use it? 
   WHAT: return is a statement that’s used to return the value of the 	function.
   WHY: because we can get the value of function with arguments (if necessary) we inserted in, and use it for next steps.
   HOW: in a function, use “return” statement with the value we wanna return. 
	E,g:	def example(a, b):
			return a + b
        to get the returned value, call the function and assign it to a variable.
	E,g:	sum2 = example(5, 6)	 

5. Do we have to use return in every function? 
   No, we don’t.

6. What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it? 
   WHAT: 
	arguments: value(s) that we insert in when we call the function.
	parameters: variable(s) we declare when define a function.
   WHY: to get some results from the value(s) we inserted in the function.
   HOW: define a function with parameters like this:
		def example(a, b): …
	call the function with arguments like this:
		example(5,7)

7. How to use function from a different file other than our currently working  file? 
   Import them all via “import” statement.
	E.g:	from f_math import calc
